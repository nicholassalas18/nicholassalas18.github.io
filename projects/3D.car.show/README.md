VR Object Loader Example
========

This example was adapted from [VR Weather Particles](https://www.sitepoint.com/bringing-vr-to-web-google-cardboard-three-js/), an awesome, step-by-step walkthrough of getting started with VR and three.js.

Once you've downloaded this example, modify the **script.js** file. Experiment with lights(), changing the texture of the floor, [adding geometry](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#Reference/Geometries/BoxGeometry), and more!

Make sure to check out the [three.js documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#Manual/Introduction/Creating_a_scene) and [examples](https://threejs.org/examples/).
